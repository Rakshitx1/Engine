# Choosing API

SFML, SDL2, Glad & GLFW, and Vulkan are all libraries and APIs commonly used in game and graphics programming, but they serve different purposes and have different levels of abstraction. Let's briefly discuss each one:

1. **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library):**
   - **Purpose:** SFML is a multimedia library primarily designed for 2D games and multimedia applications. It provides modules for graphics, windowing, audio, and networking.
   - **Abstraction Level:** Higher level compared to SDL2 and Vulkan, making it easier for beginners to get started with game development.

2. **SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2):**
   - **Purpose:** SDL2 is a low-level multimedia library that provides support for graphics, audio, input, and windowing. It's often used for both 2D and 3D game development.
   - **Abstraction Level:** Lower level than SFML, offering more control over hardware features.

3. **Glad & GLFW:**
   - **Glad:** Glad is a loader generator that manages OpenGL function pointers.
   - **GLFW (Graphics Library Framework):** GLFW is a library that provides a simple, cross-platform interface for creating windows and handling input.
   - **Purpose:** Used together, Glad and GLFW can be part of a minimal setup for OpenGL rendering.
   - **Abstraction Level:** Lower level, especially when dealing directly with OpenGL.

4. **Vulkan:**
   - **Purpose:** Vulkan is a low-level, cross-platform 3D graphics API. It provides more direct control over GPU resources and is designed to offer high performance and parallelism.
   - **Abstraction Level:** Extremely low level compared to SFML and SDL2. Vulkan requires developers to manage memory, synchronization, and other details, making it more challenging but powerful.

**When to Use Each:**
- **SFML:** Ideal for beginners and for projects that focus on 2D games and multimedia applications. It provides a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to learn and use.
  
- **SDL2:** Suitable for both 2D and 3D game development. Offers more control than SFML, making it a good choice for projects that require fine-grained control over hardware resources.

- **Glad & GLFW:** If you specifically want to work with OpenGL and need a lightweight setup for windowing and input, Glad and GLFW are a good combination.

- **Vulkan:** Best suited for advanced graphics programmers working on performance-critical applications, such as high-end 3D games or simulations. It requires a deep understanding of graphics programming concepts.

The choice between these libraries depends on your project requirements, your familiarity with the technology, and the level of control you need over the graphics pipeline. For many game developers, the choice often comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the project.
